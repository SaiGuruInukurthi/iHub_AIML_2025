QUICK REFERENCE:
===============

MUST HAVE FOR BASIC FUNCTIONALITY:
- No external datasets required for Modules 1, 2, and 4
- car_evaluation.csv REQUIRED for Mod3_Lab3

OPTIONAL/FUTURE USE:
- INDIA_685.csv (not currently used)
- sequences.fasta (not currently used)  
- spam.csv (not currently used)

GENERATED DURING EXECUTION:

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

❌ FileNotFoundError: car_evaluation.csv
   Solution: Download car_evaluation.csv and place in repository root

❌ FileNotFoundError: reviews.csv  
   Solution: Run Mod3_Lab2 first to generate this file, or create manually

❌ Missing sklearn datasets
   Solution: Install scikit-learn: pip install scikit-learn

❌ FASTA file format issues
   Solution: Install biopython: pip install biopython

DATASET SOURCES:
===============
- car_evaluation.csv: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Built-in sklearn datasets: Included with scikit-learn package
- Synthetic datasets: Generated programmatically within notebooks

For the most up-to-date dataset requirements, always check the import statements and file loading sections in each notebook.
