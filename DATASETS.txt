TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

❌ FileNotFoundError: car_evaluation.csv
   Solution: Download car_evaluation.csv and place in repository root

❌ FileNotFoundError: reviews.csv  
   Solution: Run Mod3_Lab2 first to generate this file, or create manually

❌ FileNotFoundError: Mall_Customers.csv or Wholesale customers data.csv
   Solution: Run Mod5_Lab3 cells that download these files, or check internet connection

❌ URL download failures (Module 5 datasets)
   Solution: Check internet connection, try running download cells again

❌ Missing sklearn datasets
   Solution: Install scikit-learn: pip install scikit-learn

❌ FASTA file format issues
   Solution: Install biopython: pip install biopython

❌ PyTorch/TensorFlow not found (Module 6)
   Solution: Install deep learning libraries: pip install torch tensorflow keras
